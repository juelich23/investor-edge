                CEO Tim Cook: Good afternoon everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter 
                with revenue of $94.8 billion, up 5% year over year. iPhone continues to show 
                resilience with Services reaching an all-time high.
                
                CFO Luca Maestri: EPS came in at $1.36, beating consensus. We're seeing strong 
                momentum in emerging markets, particularly India and Southeast Asia. Gross margin 
                improved to 45.2%, driven by favorable mix and operational efficiency.
                
                Guidance: For Q2, we expect revenue to be slightly above Q1 levels, with continued 
                strength in Services offsetting seasonal iPhone weakness. We remain confident in our 
                long-term growth trajectory.
                
                Key risks include: Macroeconomic uncertainty, China market dynamics, and supply 
                chain complexities. However, our diversified product portfolio and strong ecosystem 
                position us well for continued success.

                with strong multi-year commitments.
                
                Guidance: We expect double-digit revenue growth to continue in Q2, driven by Azure 
                and Office 365. AI services revenue is expected to reach $2 billion run rate by 
                year end.
